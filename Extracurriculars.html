                    <h2>📘 Grade 9 — Kenollie Summer BBQ</h2>
                    <p>For some reason a kid who was afraid of napkins was clinging onto me. He would follow me
                        around and help me with the stations I was running, It was a bit unusual. What I enjoyed the
                        most was being part of an event that brought the whole community together. There was something
                        special about seeing families and students enjoying the fair, knowing I played a role in making
                        it all happen—whether through prepping food, managing the BBQ, or handing out meals with a
                        smile.

                        The most challenging part was definitely the rush hour. The lineups grew fast, and keeping up
                        with orders while staying organized and calm under pressure was no small task. Coordinating with
                        other volunteers in a fast-paced environment pushed me to think quickly and act efficiently.

                        I chose to volunteer at the Fall Fair because I wanted to give back to my old elementary school
                        in a meaningful way. It was an opportunity to reconnect with a place that shaped my early years
                        and contribute to something fun and positive.

                        Through this experience, I gained a better appreciation for teamwork and communication. Even
                        what seemed like a simple task required coordination, time management, and adaptability. It
                        taught me that being reliable in high-pressure situations—no matter how small the role—can make
                        a big impact on group success.

                    <h2>📙 Grade 10 — Lacrosse and Badminton
                    </h2>
                    <p>In Grade 10, I took a leap and joined the lacrosse team—even though I had never played before.
                        After stepping away from hockey in Grade 8, I was looking for a new sport that would push me. I
                        spent countless early mornings practicing my stick handling, shooting, and learning the rules.
                        All that training paid off when I scored my first goal of the season. It was an unforgettable
                        moment and a proud milestone, showing me that consistent effort leads to success. We won tier
                        two lacrosse!<br><br>

                        In badminton, my partner Rachel and I had an incredible run at the South East Peel tournament.
                        We advanced to the finals after winning 3 out of 4 games. Sadly, Rachel dislocated her shoulder
                        during our second game and we had to forfeit the final match. I was proud of her for pushing
                        through two games but eventually had reached her limit. Even so, we finished third overall,
                        and I was proud of what we accomplished together. Both of these experiences taught me
                        resilience, adaptability, and the importance of preparation and teamwork. Maybe Next year we
                        will do better.

                    <h2>📕 Grade 11 — Athletic Council Intarmural Executive</h2>
                    <p>
                        Serving as an Intramural Executive on the Athletic Council was an incredibly meaningful
                        experience that allowed me to grow as both a leader and a team player. It gave me the chance to
                        contribute to the positive energy in the school by helping to organize and run sports
                        tournaments that brought students together across all grades.


                        I enjoyed seeing the school come alive during intramural events—the cheers, the friendly
                        rivalries, and the sense of unity they created. Knowing that I helped make those moments
                        possible made the effort worth it. It was especially rewarding to watch students who normally
                        don’t participate in competitive sports come out, have fun, and feel included.


                        One of the biggest challenges was dealing with last-minute schedule changes and managing
                        conflicts between teams. Coordinating gym availability, referees, and ensuring fair play
                        required strong communication and quick problem-solving. It taught me how to stay calm under
                        pressure and work with others to find solutions on the fly.


                        I chose to take on this role because I’ve always been passionate about sports and school spirit.
                        I wanted to give back to the school community and create opportunities for others to experience
                        the same joy I’ve found in physical activity and teamwork.


                        This experience taught me that leadership isn’t always about being in the spotlight—it’s often
                        about working behind the scenes to make sure things run smoothly. I learned how to manage
                        responsibilities, collaborate with others, and adapt to unexpected challenges. Most importantly,
                        I gained a deeper appreciation for the power of community and inclusion in school life.

                    <h2>📕 Grade 11 — Junior Aquatic Instructor</h2>
                    <p>
                        Volunteering as a Junior Aquatic Instructor at Huron Park was one of the most transformative
                        experiences of my high school years. It gave me the chance to combine my love for swimming with
                        my passion for helping others. From toddlers taking their first steps into the water to adults
                        overcoming deep-seated fears, each class offered something new and meaningful.


                        What I enjoyed most was the variety. Every day was different—one moment I’d be making games out
                        of flutter kicks with preschoolers, and the next I’d be guiding an older adult through gentle
                        aquatic exercises. Helping someone float for the first time or seeing a child finally swim
                        across the shallow end without a flutter board were moments that filled me with pride. Watching
                        people grow more confident in the water—and in themselves—was incredibly rewarding.


                        The most challenging part was working with individuals who had hydrophobia or physical
                        limitations. It required a lot of patience, empathy, and creativity. I had to adapt my
                        communication and teaching styles to help each person feel safe and supported. For example, I
                        worked with a young child who was terrified of putting their face in the water. We spent several
                        classes just splashing and playing near the edge until they finally felt brave enough to try on
                        their own. Moments like that reminded me how small steps can lead to big breakthroughs.


                        I chose to volunteer as a Junior Aquatic Instructor because swimming has always been a big part
                        of my life. I wanted to give back to the community by helping others develop water safety skills
                        and discover the joy of swimming. Huron Park was the perfect environment—it felt like a second
                        home and offered a diverse range of students, which made the experience even more enriching.


                        This experience taught me the importance of patience, adaptability, and clear communication. It
                        showed me that effective teaching isn’t one-size-fits-all—it’s about understanding who you’re
                        teaching and meeting them where they are. I also gained a deep respect for instructors and the
                        impact they have on building confidence and life skills. Above all, I learned that progress
                        looks different for everyone, and that even the smallest victories in the pool can mean the
                        world to someone.</p>

                    <h2>📕 Grade 11 — Varisty Badminton Team (Year 2)</h2>
                    <p>
                        This year, my partner Naya and I reached the semi finals of our region but unfortunately fell to
                        Glenforest. What I enjoyed the most was the rush of competing—especially the feeling of progress
                        after intense practice. Reaching the Southeast of Peel Division finals and qualifying with a
                        partner I had only trained with for two weeks was unforgettable.

                        The most challenging part was dealing with instability. From having to partner with five
                        different teammates to overcoming a serious shoulder injury, I had to adapt constantly. Each new
                        partner required a shift in playstyle, communication, and trust-building.

                        I chose badminton because it’s both strategic and physical. I’ve always appreciated how it
                        pushes you to think while staying fast on your feet. The sport also provided an outlet for
                        stress and a space to grow my competitive edge.

                        The experience taught me perseverance and flexibility. I learned that success isn’t always about
                        having the perfect setup—it’s about making the best of the situation and staying committed to
                        your goals no matter how chaotic things get. I will train harder next year to at least qualify
                        for ropssaa.</p>

                    <h2>📕 Grade 11 — Varsity Lacrosse Team (Year 2)</h2>
                    <p>What I enjoyed the most during my second year of lacrosse was stepping into a leadership role and
                        becoming a mentor to new players. I took pride in guiding rookies through drills, offering
                        advice during practices, and helping them build confidence—just as I once needed when I was new.
                        Contributing to the team’s development, both on and off the field, made every practice and game
                        more meaningful.

                        The most challenging part was adapting to the increased responsibility and expectations that
                        came with being a returning player. I was no longer just trying to keep up—I had to set the
                        pace, keep the energy high, and be a reliable presence when the team faced tough moments during
                        the season. It wasn’t just about my own performance anymore—it was about making sure the whole
                        team moved forward together.

                        I chose to stick with lacrosse because I saw how much it had transformed me in just one year. I
                        wanted to keep pushing myself athletically, but more importantly, I wanted to give back to the
                        team that had helped me grow. I knew I had more to contribute, not just as a player, but as
                        someone others could count on.

                        This second-year experience taught me that leadership is earned through consistency, effort, and
                        empathy. It reinforced the importance of teamwork, communication, and composure under pressure.
                        Most of all, it showed me that the true value of sports lies not just in the wins, but in the
                        relationships you build and the growth you inspire in others.</p>

                    <h2>📗 Grade 12 — Badminton Club President</h2>
                    <p>Founding and leading the Badminton Club has been one of the most empowering and defining
                        experiences of my high school career. As President, I had the opportunity to create a welcoming
                        and structured space for over 100 students to share their love for the sport—whether they were
                        seasoned players or complete beginners.


                        What I enjoyed most was seeing the community come together. Watching students from different
                        grades bond over rallies, improve their skills, and support each other during games was
                        incredibly rewarding. Organizing an internal tournament with prizes was a highlight—seeing the
                        excitement and competitive spirit in the gym made all the hard work worth it.


                        The biggest challenges came early on. Starting a new club meant facing obstacles like finding a
                        dedicated teacher sponsor, navigating school policies, and coordinating logistics such as
                        equipment, fees, and liability forms. It was overwhelming at times, but it taught me to stay
                        persistent and resourceful.


                        I chose to start this club because I’m passionate about badminton, and I wanted to create a
                        space where others could discover that same passion. I saw a gap in extracurricular offerings
                        for this sport and knew there was a demand—I just needed to take initiative to make it happen.


                        This experience taught me the value of leadership through service. I learned how to organize
                        effectively, communicate clearly, and lead with inclusivity. Managing a large and diverse group
                        improved my teamwork and adaptability, while the process of overcoming challenges strengthened
                        my confidence and resilience. Most importantly, I discovered how powerful it is to build
                        something from the ground up that brings people together and makes a lasting impact on the
                        school community.

                    <h2>📗 Grade 12 — Senior Aquatic Instructor</h2>
                    <p>
                        What I enjoyed the most was forming connections with my swimmers. Helping someone overcome a
                        fear of water, or seeing a child go from nervous to confident, gave me a deep sense of purpose.
                        Every lesson was an opportunity to make a positive impact.

                        The most challenging part was the journey to becoming certified. At 16, I had no experience and
                        could barely swim 50 meters. I had to train multiple times a day for an entire summer to build
                        the stamina and skill to pass the 400-meter swim test.

                        I chose to become an aquatic instructor because I saw it as more than just a job—it was a way to
                        empower others while pushing myself to grow. Teaching swimming required leadership, patience,
                        and care, all qualities I wanted to build.

                        This experience taught me that discipline and determination can break through any limit. It
                        shaped me into a stronger, more compassionate leader and helped me understand how to adapt my
                        teaching to different needs—whether it’s a toddler, a senior, or someone overcoming physical or
                        psychological challenges.</p>
                    <h2>📗 Grade 12 — Varsity Lacrosse (Year 3)</h2>
                    <p>
                        What I enjoyed the most in my third year of lacrosse was taking full ownership of my role as a
                        veteran player. I wasn’t just helping rookies anymore—I was actively controlling the pace of the
                        game, reading plays, and stepping up in key moments. Scoring two goals this season was a
                        highlight, but the real reward came from knowing I had earned the trust of my teammates and
                        coaches.

                        The most challenging part was maintaining intensity and focus as the competition got tougher. As
                        an experienced player, there’s an expectation to lead by example—whether through consistent
                        performance, strategic play, or encouraging others. Balancing that leadership with my own growth
                        required a higher level of discipline and awareness.

                        I continued with lacrosse because the sport has become a defining part of my high school
                        experience. It challenges me physically, mentally, and emotionally, and it’s taught me how to
                        push through fatigue, adapt on the fly, and trust in my team.

                        This year taught me that leadership isn’t just about guidance—it’s about accountability. I’ve
                        learned how to be a calming presence under pressure, how to lift others when morale is low, and
                        how to grow alongside a team rather than ahead of it. Every season reminds me that excellence
                        comes from consistency, not just raw talent.</p>
                    <h2>📗 Grade 12 — Varisty Badminton Team (Year 3)</h2>
                    <p>
                        What I enjoyed the most this season was the bond I built with my partner, Christina. We’d been
                        training since the summer—on our own time, after school, and beyond team practices. That extra
                        effort made our partnership stronger and our matches more synchronized. Even though we placed
                        5th, the journey we shared was something I’ll never forget.

                        The most challenging part was losing to our own teammates in the tournament. It was a tough
                        moment emotionally—we had trained so hard, and falling short so close to the top made the loss
                        sting even more. But it also reminded me that sports are about respect and growth, even in
                        defeat.

                        I returned to badminton for a third year because I love the blend of strategy, precision, and
                        mental focus it demands. This year, I also wanted to commit to a partner and truly build
                        chemistry and trust, which I was able to do with Christina.

                        This experience taught me that preparation doesn’t always guarantee the outcome you want—but it
                        does build resilience, sportsmanship, and pride in your work. It reminded me that progress isn’t
                        only measured in placement, but in how far you’ve come from where you started.</p>
