            I believe that technology projects turn abstract concepts into tangible experiences. Students don’t just

            circuits or coding—they build, test, fail, and improve. This active learning deepens understanding far more

                    <h2>📘 Grade 9 — Sustainable Water Wheel Energy Project</h2>
                    <p>Our challenge was to build a sustainable energy power generation plant and deliver the produced
                        electricity to a consumer. I used wood, plastic, gears, and a motor generator to construct a
                        water wheel system that successfully converted water flow into electricity.
                        I faced several challenges: when the wood got wet, it warped, changing the precision of my
                        build. To fix this, I covered the wood in plastic tape to make it waterproof. I also mistakenly
                        nailed pieces in the wrong orientation, which misaligned the axle hole. I drilled new holes to
                        adapt. The water pressure from the faucet kept popping off my homemade nozzle, so I upgraded to
                        a hose adapter, which solved the issue.
                        My design had many strengths. The gear system allowed the water wheel to spin the generator at a
                        16:1 ratio. The entire setup was light and waterproof, generating over 35 volts—enough to power
                        eight LED lights and a motor-driven windmill. My DIY nozzle design with a 0.75 cm output
                        dramatically increased water pressure and performance.
                        There were weaknesses too: the wheel wobbled due to misaligned assembly, and the caps couldn't
                        capture all the water effectively. High pressure also caused some leaking and the axle to
                        occasionally disconnect.
                        If I could redo it, I'd drill the axle holes more precisely, laminate the wood, use a breadboard
                        for a cleaner circuit, and install a brighter white LED. On test day, my power plant
                        outperformed all others—only my system could power both the lights and the windmill. This
                        project taught me how critical design, problem-solving, and iteration are to engineering
                        success.

                    <h2>📙 Grade 10 — Wooden Bridge Engineering Challenge (Under-Arch Bridge with Steam-Bent Wood)
                    </h2>
                    <p>For this project, I was tasked with designing and building a model wooden bridge that could span
                        one metre and hold as much weight as possible. This challenge required me to apply everything I
                        had learned about forces, geometry, and materials throughout the semester. After researching
                        different bridge types—including arch, suspension, beam, and truss designs—I chose to construct
                        a Pratt truss bridge because of its strong load distribution and minimal deflection under
                        stress.
                        I planned my design to scale, imagining the model as if it were to span a 100-metre gorge. I
                        considered key engineering concepts like tension, compression, shear, and torsion, and how they
                        act on bridge structures. I also learned about how materials like wood respond to these forces
                        and how joints and glue placement affect performance.
                        One of the most difficult parts of the project was achieving symmetrical trusses on both sides
                        and aligning the joints cleanly so the bridge wouldn’t twist or sag. I used diagonal bracing and
                        reinforced the base to improve torsional resistance. The finished product held a respectable
                        amount of weight, though I knew that with tighter construction and improved truss intersections,
                        it could have been even stronger.
                        Graham Monks and I wanted to push the limits of what we could do with our bridge design, so
                        instead of sticking with traditional truss geometry, we tried to think outside the box and build
                        a curved under-arch bridge. We engineered and built a wood steamer to bend wooden components,
                        allowing us to form gentle arches that would help distribute loads in a more fluid and natural
                        way.
                        Bending the wood was one of the most exciting parts of the project. It took a lot of trial and
                        error—figuring out how much steam was enough, how long to treat the wood, and how to clamp it
                        into the right shape without breaking it. The curved under-arch looked amazing and actually
                        supported a decent amount of weight, even though we didn’t follow the same straight truss
                        patterns as most groups.
                        This project deepened my understanding of structural engineering and made me more aware of the
                        balance between efficiency, strength, and design in real-world construction. I also gained
                        confidence in woodworking, planning, and applying science to practical builds.
                        Our task was to build a wooden bridge capable of holding the most weight. I learned about
                        tension, compression, and truss design. My bridge wasn’t the strongest, but the process taught
                        me how small design changes drastically affect structural performance. I also learned to use
                        basic wood tools and plan a build from sketch to execution.</p>

                    <p>What I loved most was seeing the LED cube light up with patterns I had coded—it felt like I had
                        brought something to life. The toughest part was the soldering and debugging process, which
                        required extreme care and problem-solving. I chose these projects to combine creativity with
                        engineering. I realized how powerful it is to build tangible things from scratch and how coding,
                        electronics, and design can all intersect in meaningful ways. These projects helped me
                        understand the importance of iteration and user-friendly design. I thought outside the box and
                        used copper rods as the structure of the cube instead of using the diodes of the led.

                    <h2>📕 Grade 11 — Chess Board</h2>
                    <p>
                        What I enjoyed most was bringing something I’m passionate about—chess—to life with my own hands.
                        I’ve always liked the game, but never owned a real set. So making one from scratch, especially
                        using rich woods like mahogany and pine, made the experience personal and satisfying. Seeing the
                        final 8x8 board with each handcrafted 2x2 inch square gave me a sense of pride I don’t usually
                        get from store-bought items.


                        The hardest part by far was building the base of the board. I wanted it to not just look clean
                        and professional, but also function as storage for all 34 pieces (32 standard + 2 extra queens).
                        Designing a base that could house the pieces neatly and securely took precision, patience, and a
                        few adjustments. Getting the alignment just right—especially when working with multiple
                        compartments—pushed my problem-solving skills.


                        I chose this project because it reflects who I am. I love chess, and this was a way to merge my
                        interest in design, engineering, and strategy. I didn’t want to just make something for the sake
                        of it—I wanted it to mean something. I also didn’t have my own chess set at home, so this was a
                        chance to fill that gap in a meaningful, creative way.


                        I learned how important planning and time management are for a successful project. Allocating
                        days for each part—designing, cutting, sanding, and assembling—helped keep me on track, even
                        with things like lacrosse games cutting into my time. I also gained a better understanding of
                        woodworking tools like the table saw, band saw, and planer, and how to use them safely and
                        effectively. Beyond the technical side, the project reminded me that precision, patience, and
                        passion are at the core of any great creation.

                        Most importantly, it showed me that hands-on craftsmanship can be just as rewarding as
                        intellectual work, especially when you’re building something that combines both.</p>

                    <h2>📗 Grade 12 — BB8 DROID</h2>
                    <p>What I enjoyed most was watching our BB8 droid come to life—that unforgettable moment when the
                        head bobbed in sync and the body rolled just like in the movies. It felt like engineering magic.
                        I especially loved the problem-solving journey: transforming a cardboard prototype into a
                        3D-printed, omnidirectional robot with LED lights, sound effects, and magnetic coupling. It
                        wasn’t just a build—it was an invention. Each challenge made success even more rewarding.


                        The biggest challenge was perfecting the mechanics inside a sphere. Unlike typical robots on
                        flat platforms, BB8 required maintaining balance and smooth movement within a hollow ornament
                        ball while supporting a separate magnetically-attached head. Controlling weight distribution,
                        traction, and motor alignment in a limited space pushed my design and mechanical skills to their
                        limits. Another major hurdle was dealing with judgment and criticism from others who
                        underestimated the difficulty of using tools like 3D printing—despite the effort behind it.


                        I chose BB8 because it combined engineering, creativity, and personal interest in robotics and
                        Star Wars. I didn’t want to make a basic robot—I wanted to challenge myself with something
                        ambitious, with moving parts, personality, and innovation. I also wanted to break the mold of
                        what a typical school project looks like and show that engineering can be fun, artistic, and
                        technically advanced.


                        This project taught me that true engineering is about iteration, patience, and resourcefulness.
                        I built and tested multiple prototypes using cardboard before committing to a 3D-printed
                        chassis. I learned how to balance mechanical components, route wiring efficiently, and create a
                        functional device within complex limitations. I also realized that tools don’t define the value
                        of a project—the thought process, problem-solving, and effort do. It’s not about making
                        everything from scratch, but making smart choices to solve hard problems.</p>
